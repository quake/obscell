# obscell (obscure + cell)

This repository implements a **Stealth Address** and **Confidential Transaction (CT) Token** on Nervos CKB, combining three scripts to enable privacy-preserving token issuance and transfers:

1. **Stealth Lock** – hides recipient addresses
2. **CT Info Type** – manages global issuance and minting
3. **CT Token Type** – validates per-cell token transfers

Together, they provide a privacy-enhanced UTXO token system that supports confidential amounts, stealth addresses, and controlled minting.

> **Note:** This project is a work in progress and not yet ready for production use.
